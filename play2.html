    <h6>SCENE III</h6>

    <h6 class="name Cleante">Orgon.</h6>
    <p class="stage-direction">Novel things have been happening to me,
        And for all my kindness, this is my fee.
        I lift the man out of his misery;
        Like a brother, I take him home with me;
        Each day I treat him with greater largesse;
        I give him my daughter and all I possess;
        And at the same time the lying low-life
        Looks for the best way to seduce my wife,
        And, not fully content with what he's achieved,
        He threatens me with the gifts he's received,
        And he wishes to use, in ruining me,
        Those profits he gained from my foolish bounty
        To drive me from the home that I gave to him
        And reduce me to the state that he was in.</p>

    <h6 class="name Cleante">Orgon.</h6>
    <p class="stage-direction">How's that?</p>

    <h6 class="name Cleante">Madame Pernelle. </h6>
    <p class="stage-direction">That in your home one sees the strangest things;
        Among them is the hate that envy brings.</p>

    <h6 class="name Cleante">Orgon.</h6>
    <p class="stage-direction"> Mother, what were you trying to say just then?</p>
    <h6 class="name Cleante">Madame Pernelle. </h6>
    <p class="stage-direction">I warned you often when you were a youth:
        In this world virtue is oppressed forever;
        The envious may die, but envy never.</p>
